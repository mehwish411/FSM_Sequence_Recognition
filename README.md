# FSM_Sequence_Recognition
Verilog implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) to detect sequences of four consecutive 1s or 0s, with gate-level and RTL code. The FSM utilizes a one-hot state assignment and outputs high (z=1) when the sequence condition is met, allowing for overlapping detection. Includes state diagram, logic expressions, and testbenches for verification.
